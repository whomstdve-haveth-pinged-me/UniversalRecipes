# UniversalRecipes
 
 A vision to build a universal library of my favourite recipes, without having to manually enter everything in.
 
 ## Current Features:
 
 * Built in Tesseract OCR support
  
  ## Planned:
  
  * Using photo library and camera support to import a photo or take your own
  * A simple touch and drag gesture to choose the method, notes and ingredients
  * A settings menu
  * Material design
