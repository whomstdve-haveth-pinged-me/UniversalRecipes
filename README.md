# UniversalRecipes
 
 A vision to build a universal library of my favourite recipes, without having to manually enter everything in.
  
  ## Planned:

  * Tesseract OCR support
  * Using photo library and camera support to import a photo or take your own
  * A simple touch and drag gesture to choose the method, notes and ingredients
  * A settings menu
  * Material design
  * A template based formatting system
  * Tile / card view
